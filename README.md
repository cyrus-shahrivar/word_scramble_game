A basic game that takes a list of words, choses one, then scrambles it, then asks the user to guess the word.  Upon guessing the word, the user is alerted to whether they guessed correctly or need to try again.  They can choose another game at anytime to try a different word.  The background color changes each time the user clicks 'new game'.  The site is mobile responsive and mobile friendly.
